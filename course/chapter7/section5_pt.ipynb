    "In this section we’ll take a look at how Transformer models can be used to condense long documents into summaries, a task known as text summarization. This is one of the most challenging NLP tasks as it requires a range of abilities, such as understanding long passages and generating coherent text that captures the main topics in a document. However, when done well, text summarization is a powerful tool that can speed up various business processes by relieving the burden of domain experts to read long documents in detail.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although there already exist various fine-tuned models for summarization on the Hugging Face Hub, almost all of these are only suitable for English documents. So, to add a twist in this section, we’ll train a bilingual model for English and Spanish. By the end of this section, you’ll have a model that can summarize customer reviews like the one shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we’ll see, these summaries are concise because they’re learned from the titles that customers provide in their product reviews. Let’s start by putting together a suitable bilingual corpus for this task."

The unit arrived quickly, was well packaged and arrived intact (always a good sign). There are five wall mounts-- three on the top and two on the bottom. I wanted to mount it on the wall, so all I had to do was to remove the top two layers of plastic drawers, as well as the bottom corner drawers, place it when I wanted and mark it; I then used some of the new plastic screw in wall anchors (the 50 pound variety) and it easily mounted to the wall. Some have remarked that they wanted dividers for the drawers, and that they made those. Good idea. My application was that I needed something that I can see the contents at about eye level, so I wanted the fuller-sized drawers. I also like that these are the new plastic that doesn't get brittle and split like my older plastic drawers did. I like the all-plastic construction. It's heavy duty enough to hold metal parts, but being made of plastic it's not as heavy as a metal frame, so you can easily mount it to the wall and still load it up with heavy stuff, or light stuff. No problem there. For the money, you can't beat it. Best one of these I've bought to date-- and I've been using some version of these for over forty years.'\n"

    "If you think about it, text summarization is a similar sort of task to machine translation: we have a body of text like a review that we’d like to “translate” into a shorter version that captures the salient features of the input. Accordingly, most Transformer models for summarization adopt the encoder-decoder architecture that we first encountered in Chapter 1, although there are some exceptions like the GPT family of models which can also be used for summarization in few-shot settings. The following table lists some popular pretrained models that can be fine-tuned for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Transformer model|\tDescription|\tMultilingual?|\n",
    "|:---|:---|:---| \n",
    "|GPT-2|\tAlthough trained as an auto-regressive language model, you can make GPT-2 generate summaries by appending “TL;DR” at the end of the input text.|\t❌|\n",
    "|PEGASUS|\tUses a pretraining objective to predict masked sentences in multi-sentence texts. This pretraining objective is closer to summarization than vanilla language modeling and scores highly on popular benchmarks.|\t❌|\n",
    "|T5|\tA universal Transformer architecture that formulates all tasks in a text-to-text framework; e.g., the input format for the model to summarize a document is summarize: ARTICLE.|\t❌|\n",
    "|mT5|\tA multilingual version of T5, pretrained on the multilingual Common Crawl corpus (mC4), covering 101 languages.|\t✅|\n",
    "|BART|\tA novel Transformer architecture with both an encoder and a decoder stack trained to reconstruct corrupted input that combines the pretraining schemes of BERT and GPT-2.|\t❌|\n",
    "|mBART-50|\tA multilingual version of BART, pretrained on 50 languages.|\t✅|\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from this table, the majority of Transformer models for summarization (and indeed most NLP tasks) are monolingual. This is great if your task is in a “high-resource” language like English or German, but less so for the thousands of other languages in use across the world. Fortunately, there is a class of multilingual Transformer models, like mT5 and mBART, that come to the rescue. These models are pretrained using language modeling, but with a twist: instead of training on a corpus of one language, they are trained jointly on texts in over 50 languages at once!\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll focus on mT5, an interesting architecture based on T5 that was pretrained in a text-to-text framework. In T5, every NLP task is formulated in terms of a prompt prefix like summarize: which conditions the model to adapt the generated text to the prompt. As shown in the figure below, this makes T5 extremely versatile, as you can solve many tasks with a single model:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img2](./ch7_sec5_2.png)  \n",

    "✏️ Try it out! Once you’ve worked through this section, see how well mT5 compares to mBART by fine-tuning the latter with the same techniques. For bonus points, you can also try fine-tuning T5 on just the English reviews. Since T5 has a special prefix prompt, you’ll need to prepend summarize: to the input examples in the preprocessing steps below"

For example, given a review like “I loved reading the Hunger Games”, there are multiple valid summaries, like “I loved the Hunger Games” or “Hunger Games is a great read”. Clearly, applying some sort of exact match between the generated summary and the label is not a good solution — even humans would fare poorly under such a metric, because we all have our own writing style.\n",

    "For summarization, one of the most commonly used metrics is the ROUGE score (short for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). The basic idea behind this metric is to compare a generated summary against a set of reference summaries that are typically created by humans. To make this more precise, suppose we want to compare the following two summaries:"

    "One way to compare them could be to count the number of overlapping words, which in this case would be 6. However, this is a bit crude, so instead ROUGE is based on computing the precision and recall scores for the overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "🙋 Don’t worry if this is the first time you’ve heard of precision and recall — we’ll go through some explicit examples together to make it all clear. These metrics are usually encountered in classification tasks, so if you want to understand how precision and recall are defined in that context, we recommend checking out the scikit-learn guides.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ROUGE, recall measures how much of the reference summary is captured by the generated one. If we are just comparing words, recall can be calculated according to the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Recall = \\frac{\\text{Number of overlapping words}}{\\text{Total number of words in reference summary}}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "For our simple example above, this formula gives a perfect recall of 6/6 = 1; i.e., all the words in the reference summary have been produced by the model. This may sound great, but imagine if our generated summary had been “I really really loved reading the Hunger Games all night”. This would also have perfect recall, but is arguably a worse summary since it is verbose. To deal with these scenarios we also compute the precision, which in the ROUGE context measures how much of the generated summary was relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Precision = \\frac{\\text{Number of overlapping words}}{\\text{Total number of words in generated summary}}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to our verbose summary gives a precision of 6/10 = 0.6, which is considerably worse than the precision of 6/7 = 0.86 obtained by our shorter one. In practice, both precision and recall are usually computed, and then the F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) is reported. We can do this easily in 🤗 Datasets by first installing the rouge_score package:"

Setting predict_with_generate=True tells the Seq2SeqTrainer to use that method for evaluation. We’ve also adjusted some of the default hyperparameters, like the learning rate, number of epochs, and weight decay, and we’ve set the save_total_limit option to only save up to 3 checkpoints during training — this is because even the “small” version of mT5 uses around a GB of hard drive space, and we can save a bit of room by limiting the number of copies we save.\n",
