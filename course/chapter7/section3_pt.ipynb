    "see [section page](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/3?fw=pt)  \n",
    "\n",
    "For many NLP applications involving Transformer models, you can simply take a pretrained model from the Hugging Face Hub and fine-tune it directly on your data for the task at hand. Provided that the corpus used for pretraining is not too different from the corpus used for fine-tuning, transfer learning will usually produce good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few cases where you’ll want to first fine-tune the language models on your data, before training a task-specific head. For example, if your dataset contains legal contracts or scientific articles, a vanilla Transformer model like BERT will typically treat the domain-specific words in your corpus as rare tokens, and the resulting performance may be less than satisfactory. By fine-tuning the language model on in-domain data you can boost the performance of many downstream tasks, which means you usually only have to do this step once!\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of fine-tuning a pretrained language model on in-domain data is usually called domain adaptation. It was popularized in 2018 by ULMFiT, which was one of the first neural architectures (based on LSTMs) to make transfer learning really work for NLP. An example of domain adaptation with ULMFiT is shown in the image below; in this section we’ll do something similar, but with a Transformer instead of an LSTM!"

    "To get started, let’s pick a suitable pretrained model for masked language modeling. As shown in the following screenshot, you can find a list of candidates by applying the “Fill-Mask” filter on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=fill-mask&sort=downloads):  \n",

This model was trained using a special technique called knowledge distillation, where a large “teacher model” like BERT is used to guide the training of a “student model” that has far fewer parameters. An explanation of the details of knowledge distillation would take us too far afield in this section, but if you’re interested you can read all about it in [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098136789/) (colloquially known as the Transformers textbook).\n",

The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this.
